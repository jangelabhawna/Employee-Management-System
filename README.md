# Employee-Management-System

Employee Management System is a distributed application, developed to maintain the details of employees working in any organization. It maintains the information about the personal details of their employees, also the details about the payroll system which enable to generate the payslip.

The Employee Management System enhances operational efficiency and data accuracy through streamlined employee data management. It provides a centralized platform for managing employee information, supporting organizational scalability.

I utilized Java SE with Swing, AWT for the frontend, and MySQL for the backend in developing an Employee Management System, enhancing data management efficiency and accuracy.

It is a design of an HR management system to meet needs to perform CRUD operations such as adding and deleting employees, viewing and printing employee data, and updating employee informations.

It allows you to manage all employee information in a centralized database where you can check and update and view employee details, and can delete in case employee leaves the company.
